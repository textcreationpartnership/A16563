            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The worthy Gentleman Signeor <hi>Appian de Boyſe</hi> Chauncellor of <hi>Naples,</hi> a man moſt expert, wiſe &amp; vertuous, eſpouſed <hi>Anna</hi> the elder: and <hi>Alphonſe de Barſeils</hi> eſpouſed <hi>Lucienna.</hi> The ſolemnities done, and the feaſtes and paſtimes finiſhed, it was not long but Signior <hi>Appian</hi> went to <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp; taking his leaue of his wife, went to <hi>Barſeils</hi> to ſee his brother and ſiſter in law, where hauing ſoiourned ſome daies, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all diligence to finiſh his voyage. Thus <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> remained alone very long, whereat ſhe beganne greatly to grieue, and began to thinke and caſt, which way to procure a ſeruaunt to ſupply her husbandes place: Finding her ſelfe greatly ſolicited by one <hi>Maurice Talleys,</hi> a young man, faire, and bold, but of a

Her husband hauing occaſion to ſtay at <hi>Naples,</hi> ſent for her diuers times, which ſhe refuſing, he in anger ſent her word, not to faile to come, withall vſing ſome threates: She againe excuſing her ſelfe, ſent him word that ſhe was ſicke, and that ſhe feared to come leaſt the aire of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> ſhould kill her. Some daies after being in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with her fauourite <hi>Talleis,</hi> ſhe ſhewed him her husbandes letters, whereupon finally they conſpired <hi>Appians</hi> death. The concluſion was, that <hi>Anna</hi> ſhould go to viſite her ſiſter <hi>Lucienna,</hi> three iourneyes from <hi>Lucera,</hi> at the Caſtel of <hi>Barſeils,</hi> whither <hi>Talleys</hi> alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to come and there to ende their complottes. <hi>Anna</hi> hearing that her brother in law was to muſter his quarter, tooke horſe &amp; departed to viſite her ſiſter: Being hard by the Caſtel, ſhe ſent her Lackey to giue her knowledge of her comming, wherat the good g<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman being very glad, went to meet her with her two little ſons, hauing firſt giuen order in her houſe for the entertainment of her ſiſter. After the welcomes and embracementes, they returned to the Caſtell, where they founde the table couered and the cates readie, expecting their comming, the welcomes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated, they waſhed and ſet themſelues at table, where they were ſerued with ſuch cheere as any one may iudge that a ſiſters hart could afforde. After din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the two gentlewomen began to talke of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of their houſes and husbands, where <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> greatly commended her husbande, aſſuring her

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 111 -->ſiſter, that if he had beene preſent ſhe ſhould haue had better cheere, beſeeching her to holde her excuſed. <hi>Anna</hi> ſighing, thanked her ſaying, my cheere paſſeth my deſert; but truely ſiſter, God hath done you more fauour then me, being ſo well matched with a kinde husband, and meruaile not of the great loue, which my father hath alwaies borne you in reſpect of mee, in hauing matched you ſo wel to your content. It is your pleaſure to ſay ſo (quoth <hi>Lucienna</hi>) but without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon you are more richly &amp; highly matched then I am. A figge for riches (replied <hi>Anna</hi>) ſo I had but a husband as you haue, to my contentment, and of whom I might reape ſome delight, for in truth I am as badly furniſhed with a husband as any Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this country, and thinke you not that I ſpeake this in any enuy towardes you, or any wayes to your preiudice: but I blame our Father for it, in hauing ſo badly matched me. T'is ſtraunge (quoth <hi>Lucienna</hi>) for my brother your husbande hath at diuers times beene heere, of curteſie to viſite vs, and hath remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here ſome daies (though not ſo long as wee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) in which time wee haue found him ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and graue in all his deedes, that in mine opinion we ſhould greatly wrong him to blame him: alſo hee hath at diuers times told and proteſted vnto mee the loue which he beareth you, ſhewing me the letters by which you refuſed to come to <hi>Naples,</hi> becauſe that you were ſicke, with many other circumſtances: he ſaid moreouer, that he deſired with all his heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his houſe for a time, but that vrgent affaires hindred him, that it was impoſſible (in reſpect of his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20976:4"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->office) to doe it. O God (quoth <hi>Anna</hi>) I thinke my miſchiefes increaſe dayly from worſe to worſe: for ſhe of whom I expected comfort and ſuccour, is my halfe enemie, in giuing more faith vnto the fained wordes of my husband then to mine. If you did but know him as wel as I, you would not defend his cauſe ſo much. O you know not his trickes which he vſeth at <hi>Naples,</hi> not contented with one trull, but keepeth and maintaineth three, yea foure: therefore it is no meruaile though wee haue no lineage, which truely greatly grieueth me, and it would grieue me as much to declare you one thing which lieth vppon my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, although you are my ſiſter. The young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belieuing her words ſaid, ſweet ſiſter be not diſpleaſed, nor thinke not ſtrange of the things which I tell you, for in deed men are harde to bee knowne: but in theſe afflictions we ought to pray to God, and with our vertues ſeeke to draw our husbands heartes to vs, and certainely God will chaunge their mindes: I ſpeake not this for my ſelfe, for (as I haue told you) I haue no cauſe to complaine. Here ſhe ſtopt, by reaſon of the ariuall of ſome Gentlewomen neighbours to <hi>Lucienna,</hi> and ſo their parley was broke off, and after ſalutations, paſſed the time vntil ſupper in talke: mean while <hi>Maurice Talleis</hi> with two other Gentlemen was come, the which for her ſake were very welcome and greatly feaſted. After ſupper <hi>Talleis</hi> tooke his loue <hi>Anna</hi> vnder the arme, walking into the garden, and began to talke how they ſhould performe their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and wicked enterpriſe. Sweet loue (quoth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) you know I haue againſt my will beene maried to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20976:4"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->this olde doting foole, which maketh no account of me, who I feare by his ſubtiltie will eſpie our familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which if he doe, it wil coſt vs both our liues, and therefore the ſureſt way is to make him out of the way, after the ſubtilleſt ſort poſſible, to the ende that we may liue in delight without thought or feare, and finiſh our loue in pleaſure and content, vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you ſhall marrie mee, and for recompence I will make you the richeſt man in this land. I ſweare and proteſt vnto you (quoth that miſerable wretch) not to diſobey you in any point, but to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh your will to the vttermoſt. Well then (quoth ſhe) you ſhall go to <hi>Naples,</hi> and I will giue you my Lackey with letters to my husband, and as ſoone as you ſhall haue knowne my husband, inſinuate your ſelfe into his acquaintance, by which means you may more eaſily giue an ende to his wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble daies by ſome ſecret death, which I thinke poiſon would do beſt, &amp; with leſſe perill. This counſel was by <hi>Talleis</hi> found good, the houre of reſt being come, they parted: the gentlemen to one chamber, &amp; the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women to another, where <hi>Anna</hi> forgot not to diſpatch her husband. The two ſiſters lay together, but <hi>Anna</hi> tooke ſmall reſt, by the thought of her wicked enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The morning the Gentlemen tooke leaue of the Gentlewomen &amp; <hi>Anna</hi> gaue her letters to the Lackey, &amp; the poiſon to <hi>Talleis</hi> as they had agreed. Being come to <hi>Naples,</hi> and marked whither the Lackey went, and ſo knew Signior <hi>Appian,</hi> hee ſaluted him, in proſering him all humble ſeruice, wherof he thanked him. This he continued for a great while, often ſaluting him, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20976:5"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 113 -->accompanying him euery where, where hee went. One day he made a banket, to the which amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen he inuited Signeor <hi>Appian:</hi> and in the middeſt of the Supper, and their meriment, hee ſeeing time made ſigne to a fellow (whom he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forthe nonce, giuing him fiftie Crownes) who gaue him the deadly potion. Which done, he wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a time ſo well that hee murthered him who had done the fact, thereby to make the matter ſure: and the next day tooke horſe and poſted to <hi>Lucera,</hi> to giue the newes thereof to <hi>Anna.</hi> The good Gentleman Signeor <hi>Appian</hi> finding himſelfe ill at eaſe, reſolued to go to his houſe at <hi>Lucera,</hi> whither he could not attain, but died within two leagues of the ſame. <hi>Anna</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Barſeils</hi> was aduertiſed by the Lackey that her husband was gone to <hi>Lucera,</hi> whereof ſhe made great ſignes of ioy, and taking leaue of her ſiſter, departed for <hi>Lucera,</hi> where ſhe found her husband deceaſed, whereat ſhe ſeemed greatly diſcomforted. In fine, ſhe cauſed the funeralles with great pompe to bee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, at the which were diuers Gentlemen, and eſpecially her father, the which all comforted her, the obſequies ended, euery one departed home, &amp; <hi>Talleis</hi> came to viſit his miſtris, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he told how he had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the murther: wherat ſhe was maruellouſly wel pleaſed, ſaying that thence forward they might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare liue together contentedly, counſelling him to demand her of her father in mariage, but that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or no, ſhe was reſolued neuer to haue other but him. Whereupon <hi>Talleis</hi> did as ſhe willed him, but her father gaue him no aunſwere, whereof
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20976:5"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 113 -->ſhe being aduertiſed (poſſeſſed of the Deuill) was greatly enraged, and imagined how ſhe might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged in making him die: and preſently without other deliberation thereon, reſolued to poiſon him, together with her ſiſter, &amp; her two nephewes, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take her pleaſure without contradiction, and to enioy the goods. Meane while her brother in law <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonce de Barceils</hi> fell ſicke in his houſe, to whom their father trauelled to viſite him, cauſing him to bee well tended, but notwithſtanding hee died, to the great griefe of <hi>Lucienna,</hi> and her father: his funerals being ended, her father returned againe to his houſe, leauing <hi>Lucienna</hi> with her children alone.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, a deſire tooke him to make a voyage into <hi>Fraunce,</hi> wherefore he feaſted all his friendes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the which his two daughters were not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>Anna</hi> likewiſe forgot not her diuiliſh intent. The banket was braue and honourable. The father being moued with mirth, called for a cup of wine to drinke to all his friendes: <hi>Anna</hi> faining the good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife ſtept to the pot her ſelfe, and filled a cup of wine, where hauing put the poiſon, with a pleaſant counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance preſented it to her father, who not doubting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, drunke a great draught vnto all the aſſiſtants, whereof in few dayes he died, to the great content of <hi>Anna</hi> &amp; her adulterer. <hi>Lucienna</hi> was ſent for to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of her father, who came accordingly with her two children, and was by <hi>Anna</hi> greatly welcommed, and requeſted to lodge in her houſe, which ſhe did, ſtaying there ſome daies to her miſhap, for her ſiſter ſeeing a fit time, gaue her alſo a drinke of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
